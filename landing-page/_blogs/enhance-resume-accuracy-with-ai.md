# Enhance Resume Accuracy & Customization with AI

Your resume isn’t just a document—it’s your first impression. And when it doesn’t accurately or clearly reflect your experience, you risk missing out on roles you’re perfectly suited for. Whether you’re tailoring your resume to different job descriptions or simply trying to highlight your strengths, **resume accuracy and customization are non-negotiable**.

In this blog, we’ll walk through two approaches to perfecting your resume: the traditional manual method and a faster, AI-enhanced route using [Waltzes](https://waltzyourway.com). By the end, you'll be able to decide which path suits your needs, whether you're an old-school craftsman or an efficiency-first modernist.

## Why Resume Accuracy Matters More Than Ever

Recruiters today don’t have time to second-guess unclear or mismatched resumes. According to a [CareerBuilder survey](https://www.careerbuilder.com/advice/infographic-what-makes-a-resume-stand-out), **54% of employers reject resumes that don’t match job requirements**. Inaccuracies—be it mismatched skills, outdated job roles, or vague wording—can tank your chances within seconds.

Besides matching keywords, your resume needs to communicate **who you are, what you’ve achieved, and why you’re right for this role**—with surgical precision.

## Manual Resume Customization (The Long Road That Works)

If you prefer complete control, the manual method gives you granular influence over your resume’s tone and content. Here's a step-by-step outline:

### Step 1: Analyze the Job Description

- Highlight required skills, technologies, and responsibilities.
- Note soft skills and culture cues.

### Step 2: Compare Against Your Resume

- Use a spreadsheet or a printed copy.
- Highlight mismatches or missing points.

### Step 3: Customize Your Resume

- Tailor bullet points to mirror job description language.
- Remove irrelevant or outdated roles.
- Focus on quantifiable achievements.

### Step 4: Proof and Polish

- Use tools like Grammarly and Hemingway Editor.
- Get a second pair of eyes for feedback.

It’s slow but thorough—and for perfectionists, this can feel like gold.
